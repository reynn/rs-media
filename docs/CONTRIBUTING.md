# Contributing

## Ensure builds pass

## Files should be formatted

## Pre-Commit should be used to ensure commits are clean

It's a bit annoying when commiting and pushing to run a build test and realize you forgot to check for formatting.
[`pre-commit`] solves this by providing a simple wrapper around git hooks. I've setup a pre-commit configuration for this
repository. Please setup using the guide on the [`pre-commit`] website.
